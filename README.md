Here you can find config files for my openbox configuration:

Many themes come from the amazing distro called **ARCHlabs**.

**Theme** is: __Arc-Havelock-Dark__

**Tint2 theme** is: __archlabs-arc-dark__

**Conky theme** is:__AUR-Skeleton__

**Icon pack** is: __Sardi-Orb-Colora__

**Wallpaper** is founded in the web!

This is the result
